# Welcoming Warmth

## Description

Upon entering Frosty Finds General Goods, visitors are enveloped by a magical warmth that seems to chase away the chill of the outside world. The air is filled with a comforting scent, which each visitor perceives differently, evoking personal memories of home and safety.

## Mechanics

- **Spell Used:** *Programmed Illusion*
- **Effect:** This illusion can be pre-programmed to activate whenever someone enters the store. The warmth can be a subtle use of the *Prestidigitation* cantrip to warm a 1-foot cube at a time, spread out throughout the store to create an overall warm atmosphere. The scent can be crafted using the *Programmed Illusion* spell to create an olfactory illusion that adapts to each individual's most comforting scent.
- **Duration:** *Programmed Illusion* lasts until dispelled and can be triggered under specific conditions (e.g., someone entering the store).
