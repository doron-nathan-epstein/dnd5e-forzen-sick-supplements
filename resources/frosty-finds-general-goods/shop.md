# Frosty Finds General Goods

## Description

Nestled in the heart of the quaint village of Palebank, Frosty Finds General Goods stands as a cozy refuge from the biting cold outside. The store's exterior is constructed from sturdy timber, its roof laden with a thick blanket of snow. Icicles dangle from the eaves, sparkling like crystalline ornaments in the pale winter sunlight. A wooden sign above the door creaks gently in the wind, displaying the store's name in faded blue paint.

## Interior

Upon entering, a warm blast of air greets visitors, courtesy of a magical enchantment that infuses the store with a comforting warmth. The interior is warmly lit by oil lanterns hanging from the ceiling beams, casting a golden glow over the neatly organized shelves. The wooden floorboards creak underfoot, and the air is filled with a soothing scent that varies for each visitor, evoking personal memories of home and comfort.

## Goods

Frosty Finds is stocked with a wide array of essentials and curiosities, making it a one-stop shop for adventurers and locals alike. Shelves are lined with:

- **Provisions:** Dried meats, hard cheeses, bread, and jars of preserved fruits and vegetables.

## Proprietor

The store is owned by an elderly high elf wizard named Aldorin Windglimmer, a master of the School of Illusion. With hair like spun silver and eyes that twinkle with both wisdom and mischief, Aldorin is a figure of both awe and comfort in the village. Their robes are elegant, embroidered with intricate patterns that seem to shimmer and shift when viewed out of the corner of one's eye. Aldorin's extensive magical knowledge and kind demeanor make them a beloved figure in Palebank.

## Enchantments

- **Welcoming Warmth:** The store's magical warmth and comforting smell are a result of Aldorinâ€™s enchantments. Each visitor perceives the scent differently, tailored to evoke their most cherished memories of home.
- **Atmospheric Shift:** Should any visitor act suspiciously or push Aldorin too far, the warmth of the store dissipates, replaced by a chill in the air and a foul, unsettling odor, serving as a warning to those who might wish to cause trouble.

## Special Features

- **Bulletin Board:** A bulletin board near the entrance displays various notices, requests for help, and local news, including the latest updates on the mysterious illness plaguing the village.
