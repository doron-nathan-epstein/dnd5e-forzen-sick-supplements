# Atmospheric Shift

## Description

Should any visitor push Aldorin too far or attempt any funny business, the storeâ€™s atmosphere changes dramatically. The magical warmth vanishes, replaced by an oppressive cold and a foul, unsettling odor that puts visitors on edge.

## Mechanics

- **Spell Used:** *Major Image*
- **Effect:** When triggered by Aldorin (either through a command word or a subtle gesture), this spell changes the sensory input in the store. The warmth created by *Prestidigitation* ceases, and the *Major Image* spell replaces the comforting scent with a foul odor and changes the visual atmosphere to a dimmer, less welcoming environment. The spell can cover up to a 20-foot cube, but since Aldorin is a level 20 wizard, he can cast it multiple times or use a heightened spell slot to cover a larger area if needed.
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes, but can be dismissed or changed by Aldorin at will.
