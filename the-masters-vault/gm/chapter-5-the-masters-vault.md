# Chapter 5: The Master’s Vault

## 5A. Vault Door

``` md
The field behind Elaria’s house is peaceful and serene. Her home is on a hill at the edge of Parabor, overlooking the rest of the town from the front yard. Lake Miranthi and the rest of the Merriam Vale can be seen from the back of the house. On cool Summer nights you would sit on the house’s back porch drinking cold tea after a long day of training and watch the sun set over Dolor Forest. Before you is the mysterious trapdoor in the center of the backyard. You have never see the door opened. Nine red squareshaped divots are  lined up in a single row across the door’s center.

Those of you carrying the tiles feel them grow warmer the closer you get to the trapdoor. Suddenly glowing blue letters in Common appear at the top of the door, just above the red divots. The phrase reads, “WHO IS THE MASTER?”
```

Once the puzzle is completed the PCs hear the door click. The vault is unlocked. When the PCs open the door they see a set of finely carved stone stairs leading down.

## 5B. Inside the Vault

``` md
The stairs of this chamber lead down into a room of smooth white walls that glow with a magical light. Three marble pedestals stand on top of a raised platform opposite the stairs. On the left pedestal sits a longsword with a silver hilt shaped to look like the wings of an angel. The middle pedestal holds a small, metal chest. The right pedestal has a single, perfect pearl placed on top of a leather-bound, dog-eared journal. On the wall behind the pedestals is a framed map of the Merriam Vale with all sorts of strange markings.

Suddenly an image of Elaria Feywing appears in the center of the chamber. She appears much younger than she was at the end of her life and wears beautiful, purple robes. She speaks. “If you’ve made it this far, I’m probably dead. And if radiant fire hasn’t started raining down, then you’re probably not a necromancer. That means you are my most recent batch of students.

“I know it is confusing now but all is explained in the journal and map. The sword, the riches, and the magic pearl are yours too but the journal and the map are the most important items.” The image of Elaria takes a deep breath before continuing. “This may come as a shock but my real name is not Elaria Feywing. It is Erris Dawnforge. I changed my name after my friends and I stole a precious artifact, the Eye of Death, from a group of necromancers called the Pact of the Lich.” The elf looks down at the floor. Tears form in her eyes but she does not sob. After a moment she looks up and continues. “I was the only one who escaped.”

“I hid the artifact here in the Merriam Vale beyond the Dolor Forest where few dare to go. If I have died it is most likely because the Pact of the Lich has taken my life. They are searching for the eye and will use it to change all the people of Skylark into undead. Guarding the eye is now your task. Everything is detailed in the journal.”

Elaria smiles to herself. “All of Skylark is counting on you. I hope I trained you well.” The illusion of the woman disappears.

“Touching,” a withering voice behind you comments. You turn to see the pale sunken face of a thin bald man wearing black robes emblazoned with a red skull on the chest. His green eyes flare at you from under his hood. Before the man five animated human skeletons carrying swords creek and clack as they fidget, ready for murder.
“But that map leads to an item that is and always was the rightful property of my masters. I have come to take back what was stolen.”
```

Drazal Vibbin and his five skeletons fight the PCs until death. Drazal is a true zealot and will let nothing else stop him. Even if he falls, the skeletons continue fighting, carrying out their last order to kill the PCs. Drazal does his best to keep the skeletons between himself and the characters as he rains spell after spell down on them. Before coming down into the vault, Drazal casts mage armor on himself. The ceiling in the vault is 20 feet high and stairs lead up to 5-foot high platforms on the East and West ends of the vault. Stairs on those platforms lead up to a 10-foot-high platform that holds Elaria’s treasure. If a creature falls 10 feet off the highest platform to the lowest level of the vault it takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and lands prone.

### Radiant Beams

Elaria rigged a magic trap in the walls of the room that is set off in the presence of undead. At the start of the first round of combat and then at the start of every round thereafter, a beam of radiant energy shoots out of one of the walls at random creature in the vault. Determine which creature the beam hits by assigning each conscious creature a number, and then rolling a d12 (rerolling any results which have no corresponding  creature). The creature whose number comes up must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (2d4) radiant damage. The trap stops shooting beams of radiant energy when all the skeletons are dead.

### Treasure

The sword on the pedestal is a +1 longsword that laughs like Elaria when swung. The pearl is a pearl of power. The small chest is unlocked and contains 600 gp and 7 bloodstones worth 50 gp each. The magic items are described in the COMPENDIUM window of the MENU.

Drazal carries a spellbook that includes all the spells he has prepared plus alarm, disguise self, grease, hideous laughter, and invisibility.

## Concluding the Adventure

The adventure is over when the PCs defeat Drazal Vibbin or he defeats them.

If Drazal defeats them, the Pact of the Lich finds the Eye of Death and uses it to turn all of Skylark into undead horrors.

If the characters defeat Drazal, they recover Elaria’s map and journal. The details of these items are up to you though the journal could shed some light on a few more details about Elaria’s past (see “What the PCs Don’t Know” in Chapter 1).
