# Chapter 2: Flashback

## 2A. Why Did You Come Here?

``` md
It was six months ago that Elaria Feywing, known throughout the Kingdom of Skylark as The Master, took all of you in as pupils. The old elf woman’s skills in magic, combat, and survival are legendary. She trained Marigold the Brave, who slew the infamous great blue dragon Diraxthese, and Blouton Buttertree, who closed the Demon Portal of Nargoth, and so many other famous heroes. Of all the would-be treasure seekers, mercenaries, and do-gooders that came across her doorstep begging for her wisdom, it was you who were selected by Elaria. Why did you come to The Master’s mansion before beginning your life of adventure?
```

Give each player a chance to answer the question. Make sure they understand that any answer is acceptable as long as it keeps to the theme of a medieval fantasy world. A player could say something simple like, “I came to learn how to survive in the wilderness because I grew up in a city and know nothing of the outdoors,” or have an answer more tied to their character’s backstory like, “I came to show up my father, Felgar entwhistle, who told me I’d never amount to anything.” Let the players give their own answers and take note of their responses, as you could use the details as part of a future adventure. If a player has an impressive response
award their character inspiration. They can mark that they have inspiration on their character sheet and redeem it to get advantage on a future ability check, save, or attack.

Once each player gives a response, read or paraphrase the following boxed text. Think about how Elaria might sound when you speak in her voice. You should feel free to change your voice, posture, and mannerisms each time you speak as an NPC. Have fun with it!

``` md
Over the last half-year you’ve learned Elaria Feywing is intense, but fair and encouraging. Though The Master is over eight centuries old, her elf blood keeps her thin, lithe, and youthful which allows her to enforce your rigorous training regimen. You are each learning different skills in magic, combat, and more, but you all take your meals together. 

You are sitting at a long dining table enjoying a hot breakfast together. Elaria puts down her porridge spoon and stands up, looking you all in the eye, her golden hair framing her own green orbs. She cracks a smile as she begins speaking. 

“It is time for your first test in real combat. We have a rat infestation in the basement. A giant rat infestation. I managed to get them contained in the larder, but they’ll soon eat through all our supplies and the door itself if you don’t go down there to exterminate.” Her green eyes twinkle with mischievous delight as she adds, “I also seem to have misplaced the key to the larder after locking them in, so you’ll have to get through the door and past the barricade I set up before you can get to the rats.” 

The Master sits back down in her chair and puts a spoonful of porridge to her lips. Before actually eating she looks at all of you and says, “Well what are you waiting for?” You know by now that’s your cue to head down to the basement.
```

If the characters have any questions for Elaria, she answers them cryptically or not at all. She urges them to take action in the basement. Every moment that passes is another piece of food the rats can devour. Elaria actually knows where the key to the larder is. It’s on the great ring of keys she keeps in her robes, but she won’t share that information with the PCs. If they ask where the rats came from, she smiles and says she has no idea, which is also a lie She brought them into her home to test the PCs.

A PC might try to pick Elaria’s pocket to remove the key. To do so the character must make a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If another PC distracts Elaria while her pocket is being picked, give the PC
picking her pocket advantage on the check. Success means Elaria’s pocket is picked without her noticing and the PC has the key in hand. A failure means Elaria notices the PC trying to pick her pocket, scolds that
character, and keeps her hand in her pocket so that it is unable to be picked.

If a character wants to pick pocket Elaria, reveal Handout #1 - Ability Checks in the JOURNAL window to all
players. If they don’t do it, reveal the handout later, when a PC makes an ability check for the first time.

## 2B. Basement Hall

``` md
The basement steps of Elaria’s mansion lead to a stone passage ending in a wood door. You know that beyond the door is a large larder filled with all manner of cheese, grains, meat, and produce. The rats inside can live like royalty for months on all the food within.
```

Characters who listen at the door can hear the chatter and scurry of giant rats within. The rats are so large it sounds more like dogs running around than rodents. The door to the larder is locked. The
characters can open the door in the following ways:

- **Use the key**. If the character picked Elaria’s pocket as outlined in section 2A, they can use that key to unlock the door.
- **Pick the lock**. A character with thieves’ tools can attempt to pick the lock with a DC 12 Dexterity check. If
the character has thieves’ tools, they can use the thieves’ tools to aid them in the roll. If the PC does not have thieves’ tools, a character can use a pin, wire, or similar thin metal object to pick the lock with disadvantage. If the character fails the check to pick the lock, the poison gas trap activates if it hasn’t already been disarmed (see Poison Gas Trap later in this section).
- **Force the door open**. A PC can attempt to force the door open with a successful DC 15 Strength check. The hall is wide enough that two characters can attempt this at the same time. If this happens, the character with the lower Strength bonus makes no check. while the character with the higher Strength bonus gains advantage on
the check. If this method of opening the door is successful, the Poison Gas Trap activates if it hasn’t already been disarmed (see Poison Gas Trap later in this section).
- **Break the door down**. The characters can attack the door to break it down. The door has AC 15, 18 hit
points, and is immune to poison and psychic damage. If the door is reduced to 0 hit points it is destroyed and the poison gas trap activates if it hasn’t already been disarmed (see Poison Gas Trap later in this section). When the door’s hit points are reduced to 0 it is broken down. The door automatically fails any saving throws. If the characters attack the door using attacks and by casting spells that deal damage, reveal Handout #2 - Attacks and Damage to the players and if a character casts a spell at the door, reveal Handout #3 - Spellcasting to the players. If the characters don’t cast any spells or attack the door, save these handouts for the first time one of them does the corresponding action.

### Poison Gas Trap

The lock on the door to the larder is equipped with a poison gas trap which is triggered if someone attempts to pick the door’s lock and fails, or if someone forces the door open or breaks it down. The PCs don’t know this trap is in the lock, since Elaria never locked the door to the larder during their stay before now. A
character looking at the lock can detect a small nozzle just above the keyhole with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. A character investigating the nozzle can make a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discover the nozzle is connected to a canister of gas hidden inside the door, triggered to spray when
someone tampers with the door. A character can disarm the trap with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves’ tools. If the check fails, the character triggers the trap. When the trap is activated, a 10-foot
cloud of poison is sprayed in front of the door. Each character in the cloud must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. If the characters have to make this saving throw, reveal Handout #4 - Saving Throws and Handout #5 - Conditions. The cloud dissipates immediately after it is released. You can make the cloud appear on the map by following the steps at the beginning of this section. To give the characters a better idea of how the trap works, reveal the handout Poison Gas Trap to give them a visual.

## 2C. The Larder

``` md
The heavy smell of giant rat dung hits you square in the face as the door swings open. A scamper of feet can be heard as rodents the size of golden retrievers run back and forth at the opposite end of the room amid gnawed-open crates, barrels, and bags of food. Between the rats and you is a line of boxes set up by Elaria to keep the rodents on the far side of the room.
```

The six giant rats in this room have actually eaten a hole through two of the boxes in the barricade (marked with Xs on the GM INFO OVERLAY layer of the map in Roll20). The characters notice the holes with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Once they actually walk into the room, read or paraphrase the following boxed text:

``` md
As you enter the room, two rats emerge from small holes gnawed through the barricade of crates and barrels. They hiss and attack.
```

### Barricade

The PCs can cross the barricade of crates
and barrels several ways.

- **Leap over**. A character can leap over the barricade as part of a move by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength
(Athletics) check. Failure on the check means the character’s leap isn’t high enough and they fall prone on the side of the barricade where they began their leap.
- **Move a crate**. As an action a PC can push or pull a crate 5 feet in any direction to an unoccupied space with
a DC 13 Strength check. As an action a character can pick up a crate if they have both hands free and succeed on DC 15 Strength check. While holding the cumbersome crate, the character moves at half speed. The two crates
with the holes in them can be moved without requiring a check, since their contents have been devoured by the
rats. You can indicate that a crate has been moved on the map using the DRAW tool.
- **Slide through the rat holes**. A character slides through one of the rat holes in the barricade as part of a move by succeeding on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Small characters have advantage on this check. Failure means the character misses the rat hole and smashes into the side of the barricade they started on, falling prone.
- **Crawl through the rat holes**. A Small character can crawl through a rat hole, by dropping prone and spending 10 feet of movement to crawl through the 5-foot hole. A Medium character can crawl through a rat hole, but they must squeeze, which means that while the PC is in the space it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls against the PC have advantage. A Medium character must also drop prone and spend 15 feet of movement to crawl through a 5-foot hole.

### Outsmarting the Rats

Some characters may not wish to harm the rats, but try to lead them out of the mansion by making a trail of food, luring them into crates and barrels, or using some other tricks to best the beasts. That kind
of outside the box thinking is what makes RPGs fun! Combat is not the answer to every problem. This idea applies not only to this battle, but all the battles in the adventure.

If a player wants their PC to use Wisdom (Animal Handling) to try and handle a rat, the rodent must be able to see and hear the character and the character must be Medium size. The character then makes a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. The PC has disadvantage on this check if the characters have already harmed one or more of the rats in some way. If the check succeeds, the rat stays out of the fight and allows the character who made the check to pick it up, if both of the PC’s hands are free. As long as the rat isn’t attacked or harmed by any of the PCs, the rat remains calm and amenable to being handled.

### Victory

``` md
As the last rat is dealt with, you hear the sound of applause come from the doorway behind you. The Master beams. “Excellent work. You are the most impressive group of students I’ve had in more than a century. You learned quickly that you are stronger as a team than you are as individuals.”

The elf looks at the state of her larder and gives a small laugh. “I always forget how expensive this test is.” She smiles, “No matter. Let me clean up. I think you’ve earned the rest of the day off.”
```

At the end of this encounter, the PCs should get the benefit of a long rest. That means they are completely healed, and all of their spells and abilities should be recharged.
