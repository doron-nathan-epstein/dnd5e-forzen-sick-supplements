# Chapter 3: Parabor

``` md
Welcome to Parabor, a frontier village of diverse miners and adventurers. This community’s economy is fueled by silver in the Cairgon Ranges, mithral in the Icebound Peaks, and explorers like you who scout the Merriam Vale for treasure.

The Cairgon Ranges cut Parabor and the Merriam Vale off from the rest of the Kingdom of Skylark where King Raziel Fortwyth II rules a prosperous civilization. While the small village falls under his domain, he largely ignores the village. Its operations are in the hands of Governess Judith Seagarten, who keeps a small guard and can raise a larger militia if any trouble comes to town. She lets the villagers keep to themselves, coming around with her guards once a year to collect taxes.

The dangerous jobs and remote location of Parabor attract more than miners and adventurers. Plenty of people running from something be it the law, a shady past, or an angry ex-lover come to Parabor for refuge from their previous life. This is a village where people ask where you’re going, not where you came from.

Three days ago, Elaria Feywing, a renowned mentor to many famous adventurers died. She was known in the Merriam Vale as The Master. You were her final pupils. The ancient elf who taught you secrets of combat, magic, and wilderness survival passed away in her sleep on the same night she told you your training was complete. You had not even begun to look for work when the news of her death came. Though The Master was over eight hundred years old, she was lithe and energetic. It seemed she could have lived another eight centuries.

Per the instructions of her last will and testament, Elaria was buried quickly in a simple ceremony. While many who live in Parabor came to see The Master laid to rest, you were her only students able to attend given the short notice. Golonna, the local dwarf priestess who runs The Holy Beacon, Parabor’s temple of Lux, god of light, asked you each to say a few words about Elaria in eulogy by sharing a favorite memory of an unexpected lesson the elf taught you. What memory did you share at the funeral?

After the characters give their responses, read or paraphrase the following boxed text:

When you are exiting The Holy Beacon, Yelsa Hodwick, the only solicitor currently working in Parabor, approaches. The middleaged gnome woman pushes up her half-moon spectacles, wiping tears from her eyes as she embraces you one by one, barely holding back hysterical tears. “Ms. Feywing spoke fondly of all of you. In fact, you are all mentioned in her last will and testament. If you have time today, would you please stop by my office? I know it is a lot to ask… but…” Yelsa cannot finish her sentence as the tears finally come. She walks away from you, honking into her handkerchief. “Please… stop by… later,” she manages to get out through the tears.

## 3A. Parabor Solicitor

Yelsa Hodwick, a nervous, emotional
gnome is the only solicitor in the entire
village. When the characters arrive at
her office, she is still upset over the death
of Elaria, though she has gained some
composure. When the characters enter
Yelsa’s office, read or paraphrase the
following boxed text:
A small bell rings in the doorframe
as you enter the solicitor’s office.
The smell of paper twinges in your
nose. Neatly stacked books and files
seem to fill every shelf, table, and
available surface of the gnome’s
crowded workspace. “Thank you
so much for coming,” Yelsa’s voice
chirps shakily behind her desk. The
gnome scurries off her chair and
says, “Oh excuse me. I seriously
need to file these,” as she picks up
papers off the seats of three chairs
and couch set up across from her
desk. “Now, may I offer you all some
tea?”
If the characters wish to converse with
Yelsa before getting down to business, she
is happy to get to know them better. She
does not know them well but Elaria told her
that the PCs were her favorite pupils and
often shared stories of their training. Yelsa
came to Parabor because she knew the
village was without any solicitor. She knew
if she braved the trek it would be worth her
while and so far business has been quite
lucrative.
When the characters are ready to get
down to business, read or paraphrase the
following boxed text:

``` md
Yelsa unseals a small envelope with an E.F. pressed into its wax seal. As she pulls forth the letter within the gnome speaks in a grave tone. 

“Now, as I said at the services, Elaria included you in her last will and  testament. She has no family and you are the only people mentioned in the document. She wanted me to read aloud and then give you the following instructions to take with you:

My gold has dwindled in 800 years But there’s some left, so be all ears. My mansion, my treasures are all yours, If you can open the last of my doors. The vault in the backyard is my final test, You must work together to complete this quest.

The door can be opened with strength of the mind,
But before you attempt, find the tiles—all nine!

Three are hidden where she creeps and crawls, The one with eight legs and venomous jaws.

Three are entrusted to one born of dragons, Who cannot be reached by boats or by wagons.

Three still are buried with a friend long forgotten Who lingers long after her body is rotten.

Unlock the vault! Do not delay. For others are hunting my treasure this day. Every moment you wait puts people at risk. So take up the task and please do be brisk. All will make sense when you open the vault, And realize my death was not nature’s fault.”

The last line of The Master’s will chokes up Yelsa and she sucks in her breath to compose herself. What could this all mean? Elaria’s property now belongs to all of you, that much is clear. You all remember there is a stone trapdoor behind the mansion that was always locked and had no key. The door did have nine square shaped divots in it… perhaps this is the vault Elaria’s poem refers to?

Get a player to roll a single D3 to decide what order they pursue the objectives laid out by Elaria

1. The players logically plan the quickest and most efficient route through the vale to achieve their objectives. You listened well, you feel confident, you won'y let your master down.
   1. Staircase Cliffs, Vixthra’s Lair, Dolor Forest, Parabor (3 days)
2. The players string some form of plan together to get through the vale as fast as possible, but doubts set in and the plan is not as efficient as it could be. The sound of facing a dragon is not sitting well with all.
   1. Vixthra’s Lair, Dolor Forest, Staircase Cliffs, Parabor (4 days).
3. The players couldn't be bothered. The master is dead, she holds no sway over how we do things. She was always a little eccentric... Nobody is 'after us'.
   1. Dolor Forest, Parabor, Staircase Cliffs, Parabor, Vixthra’s Lair, Parabor (5 days).

Regardless of the path you chose, your adventure was a success only due to your past few months of training.

In the Dolor Forest, you faced a pack of wolves and helped put a trapped soul, Helene Aerdune, to finally be at peace.

The Staircase Cliffs proved a true test of strength, facing a mountain climb neigh impossible. You faced off against a swarm of angry flying snakes and were greeted, hosted and entertained by the warmest of Dragonborn's Alcaeus Scaevola.

Your most difficult challenge however was that in Vixthra’s Lair where a clan of kobolds awaited. Not only kobold warriors but a kobold shaman, who prayed of Vixthra, the legendary Acromantula of the vale. 

But for you, Elaria's final students, no challenge was to big, no armour impenetrable. You, in your hearts, know you have done her legacy proud. And for all this work, you now have in your possession 9 tiles.
